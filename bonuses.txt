BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. In player class, we used the interrupt and join functions to terminate gracefully the ai threads.
In dealer class, we used the interrupt and join functions to terminate gracefully the player threads.
In dealer class, we terminated the player threads in reverse order to the order they were created in,
by calling the terminate method of the players.
2. It was used in Player class in the terminate method and in Dealer class in the terminate method.
3. We checked the log file to see that the threads were closing gracefully and in reverse order.
--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
