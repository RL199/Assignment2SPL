BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. We supported all the configuration int variables and used them instead of magic numbers.
We created fields to save numbers like freezeTimeInterval and dealerWakeUpTime instead of magic numbers.
We used featureSize configuration field to adjust the number of cards that require a set.
To use the hints configuration, we implemented it at every table cards changes.
2. to use hints, we implemented it in placeCardsOnTable method in Dealer class.
The config field featureSize was used in the size of actions queue in player class,
aiThread and player runs to check if there are enough tokens. We used it also to
determine the size of variables in the Dealer class like cardsToRemove queue in the constructor and
token_cards in getPlayerTokenCards method in Dealer.
3. We checked the our code that we didnt use magic numbers, and if we did we replaced it
with the config fields and class fields.
--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. In player class, we used the interrupt and join functions to terminate gracefully the ai threads.
In dealer class, we used the interrupt and join functions to terminate gracefully the player threads.
In dealer class, we terminated the player threads in reverse order to the order they were created in,
by calling the terminate method of the players.
2. It was used in Player class in the terminate method and in Dealer class in the terminate method.
3. We checked the log file to see that the threads were closing gracefully and in reverse order.
--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

1. We used only the dealer, player and aiPlayer Threads that already been created for us in the skeleton files.
We didnt create any more threads, and for each player object it has 1 player thread and 1 aiPlayer thread(if needed).
When the player thread (including the ai) needed to wait for the dealer and do nothing in the meantime(when the player
has enough tokens), we used the wait and notify thread functions.
2. In the Player class:
